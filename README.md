# Final Project 
## By Joey Carpenter 


#### one problem I overcame was the time functions to calculate the time elapsed.

#### My skills in computing have improved greatly since last semester. One of the main skills i learned was problem solving. In many of the assignments, I was confused about certain things and being able to work around the problems helped me a lot.

#### One skill that i have acquired is using printf in cs50.

#### computers imrpove our lives by making communication a lot easier. Eventhought my family n the united states live thousands of miles away, i can still talk to them.

#### I beleive that removing computers from our lives would make us appreciate the world more and nature more because we wouldnt be engulfed in a screen all the time.

#### It will have an impact on me because it improved my problem solving and comprehension skills.
